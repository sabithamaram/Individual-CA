# Individual-CA

A student record consists of:
Student Number (8 digits)
Name
Course code (7 characters)

Administrators would like to register students for courses in any order.
They would like to process students in student number order.
You must create an appropriate data structure for use in an  application, which accepts student records as inputs i.e. add(self,student), and stores them so that retrieve() will give the student record with the lowest student number, removing it from the collection. 
Please consider execution (retrieval) time, i.e. keep the records sorted.

Student name number and course code needs to be collected randomly from the user. This needs to be sorted without using in built sorting functions. When retrieve function is called it should show the student with the lowest student number and remove it from the list. Create a suitable data structure to handle the data and make sure the execution time isn't too long
